                       <b>America’s Sports Car</b> – Ask any Corvette owner and they will tell you that they love the feeling of starting that engine and getting out onto the road. The ease of maneuvering, accompanied by incredible performance output and power, gives you a rush every time you are in the driver’s seat and makes you proud to be the owner of such an iconic vehicle. With the combination of performance and attractive design, the Corvette’s popularity is seemingly everlasting. The two-passenger, two-door, luxury sports car has endured many changes with every generation over the last 68 years and we are excited about the long-awaited release of the 2023 C8 Z06 Corvette. Before we get there though, let’s check out the timeline leading up to the anticipated C8.

                        <b>C1</b>- In 1953, Chevrolet introduced what has now become one of the true collectible cars of our time. The C1 Corvettes were produced featuring a 235 cu. in. (3.85L) inline six engine, with an output of 150 HP and a two-speed Powerglide transmission that got you 0-60 in 11.5 seconds. The C1 was constructed with a “Polo White” fiberglass body, red interior, and a black canvas soft top and was predominantly hand built in a factory in Flint, Michigan. Only 300 were made and about 200 are still in existence around the world today. The C1 run lasted from 1953-1962.
